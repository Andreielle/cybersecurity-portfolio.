# About Me
**Name:** Andreielle Hawkins
**Hometown:** Saint Louis, MO - United States 
**Prior IT Experience:** Although I am new to the IT field, I’ve always had a deep interest in technology—particularly how systems work behind the scenes and how they can be protected from threats. My curiosity about cybersecurity began with learning how breaches happen and how damaging they can be for individuals and organizations. This motivated me to pursue formal training and hands-on experience in cybersecurity. I am excited to continue learning and developing the skills necessary to protect networks, data, and digital infrastructure.
**Career Plans:** After completing my cybersecurity course, I aim to begin my career as a Security Analyst or SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst, gaining hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability assessment. In the long term, my goal is to transition into the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, focusing on managing and securing smart contracts. I'm particularly interested in how decentralized technologies work and how to protect them from exploits and vulnerabilities. I want to specialize in auditing smart contracts, identifying risks in decentralized applications (dApps), and ensuring the integrity and security of blockchain-based systems.
**Proud Project/Task:** One of my proudest accomplishments so far has been earning the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. Completing this program gave me a strong foundation in essential cybersecurity concepts like network security, threat detection, incident response, and risk management. It was a major step forward in my career journey and proof to myself that I can stay committed and focused on building a new skillset. This achievement stands out because it marked the beginning of my transition into tech and gave me the confidence to keep learning and growing in the field.
